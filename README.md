# UCBerkeleyMLCertificate_CouponAcceptance
This repository contains files for Practical Application assignment for Module 5

In this Practical Assignment I analyzed the relationship between drivers' tendency to accept bar and coffee house coupons based on their user and contextual attributes and identified profile characteristics of the drivers who are more likely to accept the bar and coffee house coupons

Insights for Bar coupons:

1. Less than a half (41%) of Bar coupons were accepted by the drivers
2. Drivers who generally go to a bar more and are 25-30 years old tend to accept bar coupons
3. Drivers who tend to go to bars more and don't have kid passengers tend to accept bar coupons
4. Drivers who go to cheap restaurants and earn less than 50k do not tend to accept bar coupons

Insights for Coffee House coupons:
1.	Almost half of the population accept Coffee House coupons
2.	Drivers who travel at 10AM, have no urgent place to go and have passengers who are not kids are more likely to accept the coupon that the rest of the population
3.	Weather and temperature do not seem to significantly affect the likelihood of drivers to accept the coffee house coupons
4.	Gender and education do not seem to significantly affect the likelihood of drivers to accept the coffee house coupons
5.	There is no clear relationship between income and coffee house coupon acceptance rate
6.	Drivers who are under age of 21, not widowed and go to coffee house at least once a month are significantly more likely to accept the coupons
7.	Drivers who go to cheap restaurants at least once a month and who received a coupon with expiration in 1 day tend to accept the coupons compared to the rest of the population
